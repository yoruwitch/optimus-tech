# Landing Page - Optimus Tech üåê

This repository contains a **Landing Page** project developed as part of the [#7DaysOfCode](https://7daysofcode.io/) challenge by **Alura**. The design for this project was based on the [Figma prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/mm3MLozvUDGhDRTxSLlGL5/7daysOfCode-HTML-CSS?node-id=0%3A1&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=231337026&utm_content=231337026&utm_source=hs_automation).  

## Project Overview üöÄ

### Features:
- Responsive layout following the Figma design.
- Developed using **React** and **TypeScript** for type-safe and scalable code.
